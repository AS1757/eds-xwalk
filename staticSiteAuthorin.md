# Codebase only site Authoring
This document is a guide to how to edit content and manage assets for Otsuka codebase only sites.

# What are codebase only sites ?
The existing Otsuka Drupal static sites which do not recieve frequent content updates and hence, don't need CMS capabilities are migrated to AEM EDS infrastructure. These sites in their current states are crawled, their code (HTML, CSS and Javscript etc.) and assets (images, font files etc.) are downloaded, checked in to EDS codebase and hosted on EDS server. Below are these sites.
