            WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH
            DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS
          </h3>
          <p class="bold black">
            Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with
            antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death (1.6 to 1.7
            times) compared to placebo-treated patients.<br />
            ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and ABILIFY MAINTENA are not approved for the
            treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.

<p class="bold italic grey">See Full Prescribing Information including BOXED WARNING</p>
-->
          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Contraindication:</span> Known hypersensitivity
            reaction to aripiprazole. Reactions have ranged from
            pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold"
              >Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke:</span
            >
            Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke,
            transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, have been reported
            in clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related
            psychosis treated with oral aripiprazole.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):</span> NMS
            is a potentially fatal symptom complex reported in association with
            administration of antipsychotic drugs including aripiprazole.
            Clinical signs of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered
            mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. Additional
            signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria
            (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Manage NMS with immediate
            discontinuation of aripiprazole, intensive symptomatic treatment,
            and monitoring.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Tardive Dyskinesia (TD):</span> Risk of TD, and
            the potential to become irreversible, are believed to increase with
            duration of treatment and total cumulative dose of antipsychotic
            drugs. TD can develop after a relatively brief treatment period,
            even at low doses, or after discontinuation of treatment.
            Prescribing should be consistent with the need to minimize TD. If
            antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn, TD may remit, partially or
            completely.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Metabolic Changes:</span> Atypical antipsychotic
            drugs have caused metabolic changes including:

          <ul class="black">
            <li>
              <span class="bold">Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus:</span>
              Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with
              ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in
              patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including
              aripiprazole. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be regularly
              monitored for worsening of glucose control; those with risk
              factors for diabetes (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes),
              should undergo baseline and periodic fasting blood glucose
              testing. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should
              be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia,
              polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms
              of hyperglycemia should also undergo fasting blood glucose
              testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the
              atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients
              required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite
              discontinuation of the suspect drug.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">Dyslipidemia:</span> Undesirable alterations in
              lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical
              antipsychotics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">Weight Gain:</span> Weight gain has been
              observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of
              weight is recommended.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold"
              >Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors:</span
            >
            Intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to
            control these urges have been reported while taking aripiprazole.
            Other compulsive urges have been reported less frequently.
            Prescribers should ask patients or their caregivers about the
            development of new or intense compulsive urges. Consider dose
            reduction or stopping aripiprazole if such urges develop.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Orthostatic Hypotension or Syncope:</span>
            ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and ABILIFY MAINTENA may cause orthostatic
            hypotension and should be used with caution in patients with known
            cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which
            would predispose them to hypotension. Monitoring of orthostatic
            vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to
            hypotension.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Falls:</span> Antipsychotics may cause
            somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability,
            which may lead to falls causing fractures or other injuries. For
            patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could
            exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when
            initiating treatment and recurrently during therapy.

            <span class="bold"
              >Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis:</span
            >
            Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with
            antipsychotics. Monitor complete blood count in patients with
            pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil
            count or history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Discontinue
            ABILIFY ASIMTUFII or ABILIFY MAINTENA at the first sign of a
            clinically significant decline in WBC and in severely neutropenic
            patients.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Seizures:</span> ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and ABILIFY
            MAINTENA should be used with caution in patients with a history of
            seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.

            <span class="bold"
              >Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment:</span
            >
            ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and ABILIFY MAINTENA may impair judgment,
            thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about
            performing activities that require mental alertness such as
            operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until
            they are reasonably certain that therapy with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII or
            <span style="white-space: nowrap">ABILIFY MAINTENA </span>does not
            affect them adversely.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Body Temperature Regulation:</span> Use ABILIFY
            ASIMTUFII or ABILIFY MAINTENA with caution in patients who may
            experience conditions that increase body temperature (e.g.,
            strenuous exercise, extreme heat, dehydration, or concomitant use
            with anticholinergics).
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Dysphagia:</span> Esophageal dysmotility and
            aspiration have been associated with aripiprazole. Use caution in
            patients at risk for aspiration.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Alcohol:</span> Advise patients to avoid alcohol
            while taking ABILIFY ASIMTUFII or ABILIFY MAINTENA.
          </p>

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Concomitant Medications:</span> Dosage reductions
            are recommended in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and/or
            in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6
            inhibitors for greater than 14 days. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A4
            inducers with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and ABILIFY MAINTENA for greater
            than 14 days. Dosage adjustments are not recommended for patients
            with concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors or
            CYP3A4 inducers for less than 14 days.

            <span class="bold">Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:</span>
            The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABILIFY MAINTENA
            in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of ≥5% and at least twice
            that for placebo) were increased weight, akathisia, injection site
            pain, and sedation.

              <span class="bold">ABILIFY MAINTENA:</span> In a short-term,
              clinical trial with ABILIFY MAINTENA in patients with
              schizophrenia treated with gluteally administered ABILIFY
              MAINTENA, the percent of patients reporting any injection
              site-related adverse reaction was 5.4% and 0.6% for placebo. In an
              open-label study of ABILIFY MAINTENA administered in the deltoid
              or gluteal muscle, injection site pain was observed at
              approximately equal rates.

              percent of patients reporting any injection site-related adverse
              reactions was 19% for<br />
              ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and 9.0% for ABILIFY MAINTENA. In both treatment
              groups, the majority of the injection site pain events coincided
              with the first injection and were reported with decreasing
              frequency upon subsequent injections. Patient-reported rating of
              pain was similar in both treatment groups at the last injection.

          <p class="black">
            <span class="bold">Pregnancy:</span> Neonates exposed to
            antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole, during the third
            trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or
            withdrawal symptoms. There are risks to the mother associated with
            untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and with exposure to
            antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and ABILFY MAINTENA,
            during pregnancy.

            human breast milk. Monitor the breastfed infant for dehydration and
            lack of appropriate weight gain. The developmental and health
            benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the
            mother’s clinical need for ABILIFY ASIMTUFII or ABILIFY MAINTENA and
            any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from
