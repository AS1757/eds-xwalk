        "REPRISE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of 1370 patients with ADPKD. The inclusion criteria were: CKD with an eGFR between 25 and 65 mL/min/1.73 m2 if younger than age 56; or eGFR between 25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m2, plus eGFR decline &gt;2.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year if between ages 56-65. Subjects were to be treated for 12 months; after completion of treatment, patients entered a 3-week follow-up period to assess renal function.1,5",

        "1370 patients randomized 1:1 to treatment with JYNARQUE or placebo: 18 to 55 years of age: eGFR between 25 and 65 mL/min/1.73 m2, 56 to 65 years of age: eGFR between 25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 plus eGFR decline &gt;2.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year",
        "During the titration period, patients were up-titrated  very 3 to 4 days with JYNARQUE, 30 mg AM + 15 mg PM/day, 45 mg AM + 15 mg PM/day, 60 mg AM + 30 mg PM/day, 90 mg AM + 30 mg PM/day",

        "Primary endpoint: the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from pretreatment baseline to posttreatment follow-up, annualized by dividing by each participant's treatment duration",
        "TEMPO 3:4 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 1445 patients with ADPKD. The inclusion criteria were: 18 to 50 years of age; early, rapidly progressing ADPKD (diagnosed by modified Ravine criteria§); TKV ≥750 mL; creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min. Patients were treated for up to 3 years.2",

Instruct patients to drink water when thirsty, and throughout the day and night if awake. Monitor for weight loss, tachycardia and hypotension because they may signal dehydration. Ensure abnormalities in sodium concentrations are corrected before initiating therapy. If serum sodium increases above normal or the patient becomes hypovolemic or dehydrated and fluid intake cannot be increased, suspend JYNARQUE until serum sodium, hydration status and volume status parameters are within the normal range.",

<p>REPRISE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of 1370 patients with ADPKD. The inclusion criteria were: CKD with an eGFR between 25 and 65 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> if younger than age 56; or eGFR between <span class="nowrap">25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup></span>, plus eGFR decline &gt;2.0 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year if between ages 56-65. Subjects were to be treated for <span class="nowrap">12 months;</span> after completion of treatment, patients entered a <span class="nowrap">3-week</span> <span class="nowrap">follow-up</span> period to assess renal function.<sup>1,5</sup></p>

<p><strong>The primary endpoint was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from <span class="nowrap">pre-treatment</span> baseline to <span class="nowrap">post-treatment</span> <span class="nowrap">follow-up</span>, annualized by dividing each subject’s treatment duration.<sup>4</sup></strong></p>

Instruct patients to drink water when thirsty, and throughout the day and night if awake. Monitor for weight loss, tachycardia and hypotension because they may signal dehydration. Ensure abnormalities in sodium concentrations are corrected before initiating therapy.

Use with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated; dose reduction of JYNARQUE is recommended for patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
