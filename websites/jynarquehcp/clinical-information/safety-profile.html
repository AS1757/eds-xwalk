        "Most common observed adverse reactions with JYNARQUE (incidence &gt;10% and at least twice that for placebo) were thirst, polyuria, nocturia, pollakiuria and polydipsia.",
        "The REPRISE trial employed a 5‑week single‑blind titration and run‑in period for JYNARQUE prior to the randomized double‑blind period. During the JYNARQUE titration and run‑in period, 126 (8.4%) of the 1496 patients discontinued the study, 52 (3.5%) were due to aquaretic effects and 10 (0.7%) were due to liver test findings. Because of this run‑in design, the adverse reaction rates observed during the randomized period are not described.",
        "In the two double‑blind, placebo-controlled trials, ALT elevations &gt;3 times ULN were observed at an increased frequency with JYNARQUE compared with placebo (4.9% [80/1637] versus 1.1% [13/1166], respectively) within the first 18 months after initiating treatment and increases usually resolved within 1 to 4 months after discontinuing the drug.",
        "Post-hoc analysis of discontinuations due to aquaretic adverse events (AEs) in TEMPO 3:44: In total, 750 of 961 (78%) of patients treated with JYNARQUE reported an aquaretic AE; 72 (10%) of patients discontinued because of an aquaretic AE, and 573 (76%) continued treatment, The median time to discontinuation due to an aquaretic AE was 96 days (overall range: 2-877 days), Aquaretic AEs were most pronounced shortly after initiation of JYNARQUE, with tolerability appearing to stabilize by the month 4 visit, ADPKD patients at earlier stages of disease progression may be more sensitive to aquaretic symptoms, which might influence tolvaptan dosing and titration decisions for the future."

                    <div class="field_pharma_body_copy "><h3>Risk of liver injury with JYNARQUE</h3>

<ul>
	<li>JYNARQUE can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported in the post-marketing ADPKD experience. Discontinuation in response to laboratory abnormalities or signs or symptoms of liver injury (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, fever, rash, pruritus, icterus, dark urine or jaundice) can reduce the risk of severe hepatotoxicity</li>
	<li>In a 3-year placebo-controlled trial and its open-label extension (in which patients’ liver tests were monitored every 4 months), evidence of serious hepatocellular injury (elevations of hepatic transaminases of at least 3 times ULN combined with elevated bilirubin at least 2 times the ULN) occurred in 0.2% (3/1487) of tolvaptan-treated patients compared to none of the placebo-treated patients</li>
	<li>To reduce the risk of significant or irreversible liver injury, assess ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to initiation of JYNARQUE, at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after initiation, then monthly for 18 months and every 3 months thereafter</li>
	<li>At the onset of signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury or if ALT, AST, or bilirubin increase to &gt;2 times ULN, immediately discontinue JYNARQUE, obtain repeat tests as soon as possible (within 48-72 hours), and continue testing as appropriate. If laboratory abnormalities stabilize or resolve, JYNARQUE may be reinitiated with increased frequency of monitoring as long as ALT and AST remain below 3 times ULN</li>
	<li>Do not restart JYNARQUE in patients who experience signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury or whose ALT or AST ever exceeds 3 times ULN during treatment with tolvaptan, unless there is another explanation for liver injury and the injury has resolved</li>
	<li>In patients with a stable, low baseline AST or ALT, an increase above 2 times baseline, even if less than 2 times ULN, may indicate early liver injury. Such elevations may warrant treatment suspension and prompt (48-72 hours) re-evaluation of liver test trends prior to reinitiating therapy with more frequent monitoring</li>

Acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported in the post-marketing ADPKD&nbsp;experience. Discontinuation in response to laboratory abnormalities or signs or symptoms of liver injury (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, fever, rash, pruritus, icterus, dark urine or jaundice) can reduce the risk of severe hepatotoxicity. To reduce the risk of significant or irreversible liver injury, assess ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to initiating JYNARQUE, at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after initiation, then monthly for 18 months and every 3 months thereafter.</p><p><strong>Hypernatremia, Dehydration and Hypovolemia:</strong> JYNARQUE therapy increases free water clearance which can lead to dehydration, hypovolemia and hypernatremia. Instruct patients to drink water when thirsty, and throughout the day and night if awake. Monitor for weight loss, tachycardia and hypotension because they may signal dehydration. Ensure abnormalities in sodium concentrations are corrected before initiating therapy. If serum sodium increases above normal or the patient becomes hypovolemic or dehydrated and fluid intake cannot be increased, suspend JYNARQUE until serum sodium, hydration status and volume status parameters are within the normal range.</p><p><strong>Inhibitors of CYP3A:</strong> Concomitant use of JYNARQUE with drugs that are moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, and conivaptan) increases tolvaptan exposure. Use with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated; dose reduction of JYNARQUE is recommended for patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking JYNARQUE.</p><p><strong>Adverse Reactions:</strong> Most common observed adverse reactions with JYNARQUE (incidence &gt;10% and at least twice that for placebo) were thirst, polyuria, nocturia, pollakiuria and polydipsia.</p><p><strong>Other Drug Interactions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Strong CYP3A Inducers:</strong> Co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers reduces exposure to JYNARQUE.
